### ✨My Work
- **Harley:** virtual desktop assistant for Windows 10 and 11 made with Python and MySQL. Enhanced with GPT-3

- Made **Harleon**, A discord chatbot that uses OpenAi's GPT-3 API with discord.py which can be used to play with friends or for work assistance.
- Designed the UI for **AesthetiCalc**. A minimal calculator app that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing
